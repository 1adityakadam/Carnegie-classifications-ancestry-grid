## 📌 Project Overview  

The **Ancestry Grid** is a concise, interactive tool for exploring the **historical lineage of U.S. higher education institutions** using **Carnegie Classification data** from **1973–2021**.  

This project enables researchers, policymakers, and the public to trace institutional changes such as mergers, absorptions, classification shifts, and degree-granting status over time.
